# 🍃 About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

- I am a graduate student at the School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. I received my bacherlor's degree in computer science and Technology from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China. My graduation project was completed under the joint supervision of Prof. Zheng Yang from Tsinghua University and Prof. Shigeng Zhang from Central South University.

- My research interests include embodied navigation, wireless sensing, and deep learning. I am now preparing to pursue graduate studies in these areas. I have a strong academic foundation in computer science and a growing interest in practical applications of AI and sensing in real-world environments. Outside of academics, I enjoy cycling, endurance running, badminton and table tennis. I also find relaxation in listening to light instrumental music.

[**Project**](https://openmap-project.github.io/openmap.github.io/)

- OpenMap constructs an open-vocabulary visual-language map. 
- It performs fine-grained, instance-level semantic mapping on navigation scenes from Matterport3D, and accurately grounds generic instructions to the targets, where darker regions in the heatmaps indicate stronger alignment between the instruction and the predicted instance.
